  <h1>Info</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; color: #fff;">I’ve been crafting beats for more than two decades, working with artists across the Pacific Northwest. My sound blends soulful hip‑hop, R&B and experimental textures with life experiences – from running power cables at Coachella to busking on the streets of Portland. Away from the studio I’m a sports‑card collector, graphic designer and even a bit of an alien enthusiast. Allen Iverson’s authenticity inspires me to always be myself, and I try to bring that same spirit of originality and freedom into my music and design work.</p>
