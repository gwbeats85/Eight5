      <p>I’ve been crafting beats for more than two decades, starting in my teens with FL Studio, a busted mixer and some dusty records. Those long nights in my bedroom eventually led to collaborations with artists all over the Pacific Northwest. These days I compose mostly in Ableton Live, blending soulful R&B, hip hop and experimental textures.

Away from the studio, I’m a lifelong graphic designer—building websites since I was a kid—and you’ll see more of my art posted here soon. I’m also an avid sports‑card collector and a huge Allen Iverson fan. Iverson’s unapologetic style — braids, tattoos, baggy clothes and jewellery — helped usher hip‑hop culture into the NBA and made authenticity part of the game
. He showed that being true to yourself matters more than fitting a dress code
, and I try to bring that same spirit of originality and freedom into my music and design work.</p>
